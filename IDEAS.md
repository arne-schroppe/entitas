Performance optimizations

- get rid of ESChangedEntity

Unsorted list of ideas for Entitas, we need to find a place to discuss them.

- Enity should have an ID (object id is enough)
- Rename defineComponent Macro to defineLocalVariableComponent or delete it completely
- Entities should be renamed to EntityRepository after DDD concepts
- Add the singleton Macro so you can reuse (Tag) Components
- Create ES.h file witch contains all public .h files
- Create internal folder witch will contain all +Internal Categories
- Move internal API to internal Categories
- EntityRepository could reuse deleted Entities.
